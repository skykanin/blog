* Testing org-mode rendering
This is supposed to be the summary of the blog post. Here we give a short tl;dr of what the post is about.

This is the first paragraph of my awesome blog post. Clearly separated by some spacing to indicate the start of a new paragraph.

What if I want to start a new paragraph here? Does that work? Yes it does work /thankfully/ so I can use *org-mode* directly with Hugo. That's awesome!
Here is a [[https://willschenk.com][link]] in =org-mode=.

PS: [[https://niklasfasching.github.io/go-org][This]] was an amazing resource

* Coding test
This is clearly a new subsection of the blog post. With it's own separate title and text. Here I'll attempt to
write some code. This specific example illustrates how one would go about making a linked list in Haskell with
type information about whether or not the list contains any elements. This way we can create a =safeHead=
function which gives a type error if one provides an empty =List=.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
{-# LANGUAGE DataKinds, GADTs #-}

-- Promoted data type
data State = 'Empty | 'NonEmpty

data List State a where
  Nil :: List 'Empty a
  Cons :: a -> List s a -> List 'NonEmpty a

safeHead :: List NonEmpty a -> a
safeHead (Cons x _) = x

* Lists
My list:
- Apple
- Orange
- Pear
- Mango


* Tables
How about tables then?
